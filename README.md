# Fintech_Churn_Analysis
**Problem Statement**: In the competitive banking industry, understanding the factors influencing customer retention is crucial. This
project analyzes customer data to identify key predictors of churn and develop strategies to enhance retention and reduce churn rates.

**Target Metrics**: Customer attributes affecting churn, churn rates by geography and gender, correlation between financial and
behavioral factors with churn.

**Approach**: Conducted descriptive statistics to summarize data, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify churn predictors,
and applied correlation and comparative analysis. Investigated customer profiles, financial factors, and satisfaction levels, and
examined the impact of card usage and salary on churn.

**Metrics Achieved**: Identified significant churn predictors including customer balance, activity level, and complaints. Analyzed churn
rates across different demographics and financial attributes.

**Insights and Recommendations**: Found that lower balances and frequent complaints correlate with higher churn rates.
Recommended targeted interventions for high-risk segments, improved customer support for complainers, and personalized retention
strategies based on customer financial profiles.
